## Original Post

### Hook
My 1-person business is about to cross $200k/mo.

### Rehook
0 outbound. 0 cold emails. Here's the breakdown:

### Body
1. Education-focused content on LinkedIn (positioning)
   - 2x specific breakdowns (like this one)
   - 2x broad education on business tips

2. Lead-magnet posts (non-negotiable)
   - Driving traffic to email is key for conversion
   - Send a weekly newsletter to keep users engaged

3. Webinars and LinkedIn Lives
   - Honestly, don't know why more people aren't doing these
   - These are the real money printers in B2B
   - 1x LinkedIn post per webinar
   - 3x emails pushing people to sign up
   - 5x emails to the waitlist to increase attendance
   - 3x post webinar emails to increase conversions

4. Selective collaborations
   - Join "forces" with people who share a similar ICP
   - Engage with them, cross-post each other (works)
   - Do free masterclasses inside of their programmes

The easiest way to acquire warm leads who are problem-aware and receptive to your offer.

### Wrap-up
That is it.
Every week.
Rinse and repeat.

### CTA
PS: We have 2 spots left for my next LinkedIn x Business 4 week accelerator (kicks off monday!)
