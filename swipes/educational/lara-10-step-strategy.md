## Original Post

### Hook
This is the exact lead gen strategy I'm using in 2026.

### Rehook
It made me over $1M in 2025, so I'm using it again:

### Body
Ready? (Like + repost to help others)

The 10-Step Strategy (copy me):

1. Storytelling content to reach new audiences fast
2. Highly tactical content to nurture them weekly
3. Using tactical CTA's at the end of EVERY post
4. Posting 1-2 lead magnets weekly to grow email
5. Sending 1 weekly email to that same list to nurture
6. Launching 1 NEW offer every quarter to my audience
7. Selling it primarily via daily emails for around 10 days
8. Funnel warm buyers to a webinar to 3x conversions
9. Build a 10/10 product/offer and overdeliver for them
10. Use steps 1-9 to create new offer and more content

### Wrap-up
The entire lead generation playbook is right there.

Want me to implement it with you? Let's do it.

On January 22nd I'll be going LIVE for 2 hours breaking down exactly how you can use this for your business.

I'll be covering every step in excruciating detail.
My team and I have been working on this for 1 month.

No old stuff, no old tactics, no algo hacks.

Actual real strategies that are proven to work even if your business is "boring".

### Engagement Question
PS: Which 1 out the 10 is the HARDEST for you?

## Why It Works

1. **Specific, dated hook** - "in 2026" makes it current/relevant
2. **Credibility in rehook** - "$1M in 2025" proves it works
3. **Numbered list** - 10 steps is comprehensive but scannable
4. **Actionable steps** - Each point is something they can do
5. **Strong TLDR** - "The entire lead generation playbook is right there"
6. **Engagement question** - "Which 1 is HARDEST?" invites discussion
7. **Soft pitch** - Webinar offer follows value delivery

## How to Adapt for Your Industry

**Hook options**:
- "This is the exact client acquisition system I'm using in 2026."
- "My [business/project] pipeline process. It brought in $X last year."
- "How I stay booked 6 months out. The full system:"

**10 steps adapted for your business**:
1. [Industry-specific] content that showcases expertise (LinkedIn posts)
2. Case studies that demonstrate results
3. CTAs that offer value (assessments, audits, consultations)
4. Lead magnets ([calculators, checklists, guides] relevant to your audience)
5. Email nurture with [technical/valuable] insights
6. Quarterly webinar or [industry-specific] workshop
7. Follow-up sequence after interest shown
8. Proposal process that demonstrates understanding
9. Overdeliver on first project (builds referrals)
10. Document wins → create new content → repeat

**Engagement question adaptation**:
- "Which step is your bottleneck?"
- "What's the hardest part of your business development?"
- "Where do most of your [clients/projects] come from?"
