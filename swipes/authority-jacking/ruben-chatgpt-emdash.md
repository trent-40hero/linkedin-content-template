## Why It Works

1. **Pattern recognition** - Identifies something everyone notices but can't name
2. **Meta-commentary** - Talking about AI content on a platform flooded with it
3. **Educational value** - Teaches people to spot something
4. **Visual proof** - Screenshots make it undeniable
5. **Timely** - AI content detection is a hot topic
6. **Positions as expert** - "I notice things others don't"

## Key Pattern

### Pattern Recognition Formula
1. **Notice a recurring pattern** others haven't articulated
2. **Give it a name or framework** (the "em-dash pattern")
3. **Provide visual examples** as proof
4. **Explain why it matters** to your audience
5. **Position yourself as the observer** who spotted it

### What to Look For
- Repeated phrases in AI-generated content
- Common mistakes in your industry
- Patterns in successful projects/failures
- Trends you're seeing across clients
- Changes in how people work/communicate

## How to Adapt for Your Industry

**Pattern recognition opportunities**:

1. **Vendor patterns**:
   - "The phrase that tells me a vendor demo will fail"
   - "3 words in a proposal that predict scope creep"
   - "How to spot [a service provider] who's never [done the actual work]"

2. **Project patterns**:
   - "The meeting request that predicts a troubled project"
   - "The [code/document/process] pattern that guarantees future headaches"
   - "The dashboard metric that's always wrong"

3. **Industry patterns**:
   - "The '[buzzword transformation]' slide that means nothing will change"
   - "How to spot [hype] vs [what actually works in your industry]"
   - "The budget line item that tells me this project will fail"

**Example adaptation**:

```
How to spot a "[transformation initiative]" that will fail:

The PowerPoint says "[industry buzzword]"
But the plan says "[install generic solution]"

Real transformation patterns I look for:

✓ Specific problems being solved (not "innovation")
✓ Metrics that existed BEFORE the project
✓ Someone accountable for outcomes

❌ "World-class" anything
❌ "Synergy" in the first 3 slides
❌ No mention of who maintains it

What patterns do you look for?
```

**Key success factors**:
- Be specific (the exact phrase, pattern, or signal)
- Provide proof (examples, screenshots, stories)
- Add expertise (why YOU noticed this)
- Make it useful (now they can spot it too)
