## My Strategic Arbitrage

Taking what works + my unique story/skill:

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: What makes YOUR perspective rare? The intersection of two skills/experiences that few people have. -->

### Unique Positioning

## Three Attention Pillars

Rotate these content types for distribution:

### 1. High-Level Educational Content
Share full blueprints, be specific. Give away the "how."

**Structure**: Bold claim hook -> intrigue -> full breakdown -> "That's it. Rinse and repeat."

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: List 5 topics you can teach in depth -->
**Topics I can educate on**:
- [How-to topic 1 — e.g., "How I structure discovery calls that convert at 40%"]
- [How-to topic 2 — e.g., "My exact process for qualifying enterprise leads"]
- [How-to topic 3]
- [How-to topic 4]
- [How-to topic 5]

### 2. Elite Tier Storytelling
Emotional narratives tied to business. Personal vulnerability + professional lesson.

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: List story angles from your career -->
**Elements**:
- [Your career journey or pivot]
- [Client transformation stories (anonymized)]
- [Lessons from failures]
- [Why you do what you do now]
- [The moment everything changed for you professionally]

**Always tie back to business relevance for [YOUR_ICP].**

### 3. Authority Jacking
Ride trending topics in your industry with your unique lens.

**Pattern**: "[Industry news] just dropped -> Here's what it means for [YOUR_ICP]"

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: What news/trends does your audience care about? -->
**Topics to watch**:
- [Industry trend or news source 1]
- [Industry trend or news source 2]
- [Industry trend or news source 3]
- [Technology or platform updates relevant to your audience]
- [Workforce or market shift discussions]

**LinkedIn gets news late — you can be first with the [YOUR_INDUSTRY] angle.**

## Voice Guidelines

### Tone
- Professional but conversational, like talking to a colleague at a trade show
- Use "I" heavily — personal experience is the differentiator
- Specific, not generic — real technologies, real numbers, real scenarios
- Occasionally vulnerable about challenges and mistakes
- Helpful, not promotional
- Show expertise without lecturing

### What to Avoid
- Generic "we're excited to announce" corporate speak
- Over-hyped adjectives (revolutionary, game-changing, disruptive)
- Vendor pitch language
- Clickbait headlines
- Asking for likes/shares explicitly
- Being preachy or lecturing

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Add 3-5 phrases that sound like YOU -->
### Signature Phrases/Patterns
- "[Your credential] + [unexpected insight]..."
- "Most [ICP] are sleeping on [capability]..."
- "I tested [thing] so you don't have to..."
- "Here's what the hype misses about [your industry]..."
- "This is the exact [process/tool] I use for [task]..."

## Safety & Compliance Rules

### Posting Schedule (NEVER VIOLATE)
- **4 posts per week maximum**
- **Preferred days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Backup days**: Monday, Friday (use occasionally for variety)
- **Never post on weekends** (Saturday/Sunday)
- **Business hours only**: 7am-6pm Eastern
- **Optimal windows**: 8-10am ET or 12-2pm ET

### Timing Rules

- **Prefer skipping days between posts** — no more than 3 consecutive posting days

### Content Rules
- **Word count**: 100-300 words, NEVER exceed 300
- **Hashtags**: 0-3 per post maximum (vary: sometimes 0, sometimes 1-2, rarely 3)
- **Links**: Maximum 20% of posts, prefer putting links in first comment
- **No consecutive same format** — rotate story/insight/question/list/observation
- **No consecutive same pillar** — rotate educational/storytelling/authority-jacking

### Red Flags to Avoid (These get accounts flagged)
- Posting at exact same time daily
- Identical opening phrases repeatedly
- Posting every single day without breaks
- Links in every post
- 5+ hashtags per post
- Perfectly formatted posts every time
- Over-promotional language
- Copy/paste obvious templates
- Posts that are all the same length

### Authenticity Markers

## Content Type Distribution Targets

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Adjust percentages to match your content strategy -->

|--------|----------|
| Story | 30% |
| Insight | 30% |
| Question | 20% |
| List | 10% |
| Observation | 10% |

---

## Hashtag Strategy

### Core Principle: Target the ICP, Not the Topic

Your content is *about* your expertise, but your audience isn't searching for topic hashtags. They're browsing industry hashtags.

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Replace with hashtags YOUR audience follows -->

**Use industry-focused hashtags for discovery:**
- [#YourIndustry]
- [#YourAudienceRole]
- [#IndustryTerm1]
- [#IndustryTerm2]

**Avoid or minimize topic-focused hashtags:**
- Generic topic tags attract enthusiasts, not buyers

**The logic:** Your expertise is the differentiator in the *content*, not in the *discovery*. Your ICP finds you through industry hashtags, then sees you're the person bridging [your unique angle]. The content sells the expertise; the hashtags get the right eyes on it.

### Hashtags to Rotate

Use 0-3 per post, never repeat same set:
- [#Primary1]
- [#Primary2]
- [#Primary3]
- [#General1]
- [#General2]
- [#Occasional1] (sparingly)

---

## Weekly Workflow

### Content Intelligence (Optional)

If you want to fuel your topic bank with real-world data, set up a weekly intelligence gathering habit. The concept: pull from multiple data sources, analyze each for content-worthy themes, cross-reference across sources, and feed the best ideas into your topic bank.

**Example data sources** (pick whatever works for you):
- Social media comments on your posts or in your niche
- Meeting notes or call transcripts
- Daily journal or activity log
- CRM notes from client conversations
- Customer support tickets or FAQs
- Industry forums, Slack communities, Reddit threads
- Conference notes or webinar Q&As

**The methodology:**
1. **Gather** — Pull raw data from your sources weekly
2. **Analyze** — Create `topics/[source]/analysis-YYYY-wXX.md` for each source documenting themes, questions, audience language
3. **Cross-reference** — Themes appearing in multiple sources get highest content priority
4. **Track trends** — Maintain a `topics/TRENDS.md` to track which themes are rising, steady, or fading over time
5. **Feed the bank** — Add best ideas to `topics/ideas.md` with source attribution

**Historical data accumulates.** Each week's analysis files are archived permanently. After 3+ weeks, use your trends tracker to identify what to double down on vs. what was a one-off spike.

### Content Creation

1. **Topic selection**: Pick 4 topics from `topics/ideas.md` balancing pillars/formats
2. **Content creation**: Draft each post using frameworks below
3. **Validation**: Check against `frameworks/post-checklist.md`
4. **Scheduling**: Generate compliant random times with `tool/schedule.py`
5. **Export**: Create automation JSON with `tool/export.py`

**Step 4: Write the Post**

- End with clear TLDR or call to engage

**Step 5: Validate**
- Run through `frameworks/post-checklist.md`
- Check word count (100-300), hashtags (0-3), format variety

- **Controversial** — Pattern interrupts, bold claims

## Key Reminders

- **Quality over volume** — 4 posts/week done well beats 7 posts of filler
- **Call to engage > Call to action** — questions beat sales pitches
- **8-word hooks** — short, punchy, curiosity-creating
- **Rehook with specifics** — numbers, outcomes, intrigue
- **TLDR under 20 words** — clear wrap-up
- **Your content isn't boring. Your ideas aren't basic. The way you write them matters.**
