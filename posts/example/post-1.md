I solved a $10K problem in 30 minutes.

Not because I'm brilliant. Because I'd seen it before.

Last week a client called with an issue that was costing them $10K/month. Their team had been working on it for weeks.

I asked three questions:

1. When did it start?
2. What changed right before?
3. Who was the last person to touch it?

Turns out, a well-meaning team member had changed one setting three weeks ago. Nobody connected the dots.

The fix took 30 minutes. The lesson took me 15 years to learn:

Most expensive problems have simple root causes. But you need enough experience to ask the right questions.

Stop troubleshooting symptoms. Start asking what changed.

What's the most expensive "simple fix" you've ever found?
