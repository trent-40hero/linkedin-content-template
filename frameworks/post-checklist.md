# Post Structure Checklist

Use this to validate every post before scheduling.

---

## 1. Hook (First Line)

**8 words maximum. Creates curiosity gap.**

### Validation
- [ ] 8 words or less
- [ ] Uses "I've", "How I", or bold statement
- [ ] Creates curiosity - reader MUST click "see more"
- [ ] Broad enough to attract, specific enough to intrigue

### Hook Patterns That Work
| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Personal revelation | "I've been doing this wrong for years." |
| Specific outcome | "I saved a client $40K last month." |
| Contrarian take | "Most AI projects fail. Here's why." |
| Question setup | "Why do 90% of integrations go over budget?" |
| Story tease | "I almost walked away from this deal." |

### Hook Red Flags
- Too long (over 8 words)
- Generic ("Here are some tips...")
- No curiosity gap ("5 ways to improve...")
- Sounds like AI slop ("In today's fast-paced world...")

---

## 2. Rehook (Second Line)

**Specific outcome or number. Drags the hook out longer.**

### Validation
- [ ] Contains a specific number, outcome, or detail
- [ ] Forces the "see more" click
- [ ] Adds intrigue, doesn't resolve the hook yet

### Rehook Examples
| Hook | Rehook |
|------|--------|
| "I saved a client $40K last month." | "Not with fancy AI. With pattern recognition." |
| "This is the exact strategy I'm using in 2026." | "It made me over $1M in 2025, so I'm using it again:" |
| "I fired my best engineer last Tuesday." | "Not because he wasn't talented. Because he couldn't teach." |

### What Makes a Good Rehook
- Adds specificity (numbers, timeframes, details)
- Creates tension or contradiction
- Builds on the hook without resolving it
- Makes clicking "see more" irresistible

## 3. Body Structure

**Varied sentence lengths. Never walls of text.**

### Validation
- [ ] No paragraphs longer than 3 lines
- [ ] Mix of short (1 line) and medium (2-3 lines) blocks
- [ ] White space between ideas
- [ ] Either step-by-step OR story-outcome structure

### Ideal Pattern
```
1 line statement.

1 line statement.

2-3 line explanation or context
that builds on the point above.

1 line transition or key point.

Numbered list or actionable steps:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

1 line result or proof.
```

### Body Red Flags
- Wall of text (5+ lines with no break)
- All same-length sentences
- No clear structure
- Meandering without point

---

## 4. Wrap-up

**Clear TLDR-style conclusion. Under 20 words.**

### Validation
- [ ] Under 20 words
- [ ] Summarizes the key takeaway
- [ ] Feels conclusive (not abrupt)

### Wrap-up Examples
- "The entire lead generation playbook is right there."
- "That's it. Every week. Rinse and repeat."
- "The lesson: AI transformation isn't about replacing your team."
- "Simple. Brutal. Effective."

---

## 5. Call to Engage (NOT Call to Action)

**Questions beat sales pitches. Always.**

### Validation
- [ ] Ends with engagement, not promotion
- [ ] Question invites genuine discussion
- [ ] No "DM me" or "book a call"
- [ ] No "like and share"

### Good Examples
- "What's one repetitive decision in your operation that could benefit from this?"
- "Which of these resonates most with your situation?"
- "I'm curious - are you seeing this pattern too?"
- "PS: Which 1 out of the 10 is the HARDEST for you?"

### Bad Examples (NEVER USE)
- "DM me to learn more"
- "Book a call to discuss"
- "Like and share if you agree"
- "Follow for more tips"
- "Link in comments"

### Length & Format
