# PAS Framework

Problem - Agitate - Solution. Use this for more direct, pain-point focused content.

---

## P - Problem

**State the pain point directly. Be bold.**

### Rules
- Call out the problem specifically
- Don't soften it - be direct
- Make them feel seen ("this is me")
- Can be confrontational (in a helpful way)

### Examples
- "Founders, your LinkedIn content sucks."
- "Most AI projects fail in the first 6 months."
- "Your team is drowning in false alarms."
- "That 'analytics' dashboard? It's just expensive decoration."

### Adapt to Your Industry
- "Your [critical system] is a liability, not an asset."
- "That [important process] hasn't been documented since 2015."
- "Your [vulnerability] is one [threat] away from [consequence]."
- "The skills gap isn't coming. It's here."

---

## A - Agitate

**Make it hurt. Show the real cost of the problem.**

### Rules
- Quantify the pain when possible (dollars, time, risk)
- Show the consequences of inaction
- Make them uncomfortable enough to want the solution
- Don't be manipulative - be truthful about real impacts

### Examples
- "It's costing you 1000s of dollars daily."
- "Every hour of unplanned downtime costs $10K-$50K."
- "Your best technician retires in 18 months. Then what?"
- "That 'minor' integration issue delayed the project 3 months."

### Adapt to Your Industry
- "Last year, companies in your space lost $[X]B to [preventable problem]."
- "Your best [role] retires in 18 months. Then what?"
- "That undocumented [system]? It runs your highest-margin [operation]."
- "Your competitor just automated what takes your team 40 hours/week."

### Agitation Patterns
```
[Problem statement]

And it's getting worse.

[Specific consequence 1]
[Specific consequence 2]
[Future risk if unchanged]
```

---

## S - Solution

**Provide your answer. Deliver the value.**

### Rules
- Transition clearly: "Here's how to fix it:" or "Here's what works:"
- Be specific and actionable
- Show your expertise through the solution
- Can be a framework, steps, or mindset shift

### Examples
- "Here's how to write content that sells:"
- "The fix is simpler than you think:"
- "Here's the 3-step process I use with every client:"
- "Start with these questions before any project:"

### Adapt to Your Industry
- "Here's how I evaluate [investment type] ROI:"
- "The documentation system that actually gets used:"
- "Three questions to ask before any [project type]:"
- "How to build a roadmap that survives budget cuts:"

## Full PAS Example

```
Your maintenance team is drowning in false alarms.

I see this in almost every plant I visit.

The "predictive maintenance" system generates 200 alerts/day.
Your team ignores 195 of them because they're noise.
The 5 real issues? They get lost in the flood.

Meanwhile, leadership wonders why you're not seeing ROI on that expensive system.

Here's the fix:

1. Audit your alert thresholds - most are set at vendor defaults (useless)
2. Categorize: critical (act now), warning (plan), informational (log only)
3. Route differently - critical goes to phone, warning goes to daily review
4. Measure: track alert-to-action ratio weekly

I helped a client reduce alerts from 200/day to 15/day.
Same system. Just configured properly.

Their team actually responds to alerts now.

What's your alert-to-action ratio?
```

### Breakdown
- **P (Problem)**: "Your maintenance team is drowning in false alarms"
- **A (Agitate)**: 200 alerts/day, 195 ignored, real issues lost, no ROI
- **S (Solution)**: 4-step process with specific example

## Key Insight

> "Your content isn't boring. Your ideas aren't basic.
> **The way you write them is.**"

The PAS framework forces you to lead with the reader's pain, not your solution. They don't care about your solution until they feel the problem.

## When to Use PAS vs SLAY

| Use PAS When... | Use SLAY When... |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Addressing a common pain point | Sharing a personal story/lesson |
| Being more direct/confrontational | Being more narrative/relational |
| The problem is well-known | You have a unique angle/insight |
| You want to create urgency | You want to build connection |
| Promoting a specific solution | Sharing expertise broadly |

Both frameworks can be mixed - start with a story (S), then PAS the lesson.
