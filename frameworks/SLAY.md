# SLAY Framework

The primary writing framework for LinkedIn posts. Use this for most content.

---

## S - Story

**Start with 1 line of a story. Hook your audience in.**

### Rules
- The hook should say "I've" or "How I" (or similar personal framing)
- **8 words maximum** for the hook
- Creates a curiosity gap - they MUST click "see more"
- Broad enough to attract attention, specific enough to intrigue

### Examples
- "I've read many books, but this one changed my life:"
- "I fired my best engineer last Tuesday."
- "After 22 years in automation, I made this mistake."
- "How I saved a client $40K with one sensor."
- "I almost walked away from this industry."

### Adapt to Your Industry
- "I've seen hundreds of [systems] fail. Here's the pattern."
- "How I learned [technology] was wrong for this project."
- "I spent 3 days debugging a $2 problem."
- "After [X] years, I still make this mistake."

---

## L - Lesson

**Bring in a quick key lesson. No fluff.**

### Rules
- Simply state the "thing" - the insight, the lesson, the realization
- Move on to explaining why it is important for your reader
- Be direct - don't bury the lead
- This is where you transition from story to value

### Examples
- "Here's how to apply his 6 principles to win LinkedIn:"
- "The problem wasn't the technology. It was the process."
- "Here's what separates good consultants from great ones:"
- "This is why most projects fail in the first 90 days:"

### Structure
```
[Story hook - 8 words]
[Rehook - specific outcome/number]

[Lesson statement]

[Why it matters to them]
```

---

## A - Actionable Advice

**Use this to showcase your expertise. Give them something they can implement immediately.**

### Rules
- Use a simple listicle format
- Numbered steps work best
- Each point should be actionable, not just informational
- Show your expertise through practical advice
- Be specific - technologies, numbers, real scenarios

### Examples
```
Here's the 3-step process:

1. Start with the data you already have (CRM, logs, existing reports)
2. Pick ONE repetitive decision a human makes 50x/day
3. Build a simple model for that. Not fancy. Just consistent.
```

### Adapt to Your Industry
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Troubleshooting checklists
- Evaluation criteria for tools/vendors
- Common mistakes with fixes
- ROI calculation frameworks

---

## Y - You

**Bring it back to the audience. Call them out. Give them something to take action on.**

### Rules
- Make it feel like you spoke directly at them
- Call to **engage**, not call to action
- Questions beat sales pitches
- Give them something to think about or do
- End on resonance, not promotion

### Good Examples
- "Master these principles → you'll become unstoppable."
- "What's the one repetitive decision in your operation that could use this?"
- "Which of these resonates most with your situation?"
- "I'm curious - are you seeing this pattern too?"

### Bad Examples (AVOID)
- "DM me to learn more"
- "Book a call to discuss"
- "Like and share if you agree"
- "Follow for more tips"

## Full SLAY Example

```
I saved a client $40K last month.

Not with fancy AI. With pattern recognition.

Here's what actually works on the shop floor:

Most system integrators treat AI like magic. "Install this, problems solved."

But here's the truth after 22 years:

1. Start small - pick ONE repetitive decision
2. Model that decision with data you already have
3. Deploy it. Learn from it. Iterate.

Last month's win? Air cylinder monitoring. Not revolutionary. Just consistent pattern recognition that used to require someone watching dashboards.

Result: 3 potential failures caught before they happened.

The lesson: AI transformation isn't about replacing your team. It's about giving them better tools.

What's one repetitive decision in your operation that could benefit from this approach?
```

### Breakdown
- **S (Story)**: "I saved a client $40K last month." (8 words, curiosity)
- **L (Lesson)**: "Here's what actually works on the shop floor" (transitions to value)
- **A (Actionable)**: 3-step numbered process they can implement
- **Y (You)**: Engagement question about their operation
