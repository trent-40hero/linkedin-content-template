## 6. Find Your Unfair Advantage & Stand Out

```
Based on what you know about me, I want you to act as a motivational coach and personal brand expert and help me find my unfair advantages.

These are topics I can talk about on my social media that would set me apart.

[WRITE THE TOPICS HERE]

I want you to focus on two types with 5 different examples underneath. No longer than 8 words each.

First is monetisable expertise, for example:

My copywriting friend - she's written viral frameworks that make people convert their content into sales.

My seo friend - he's got every system to get his clients to rank on Google - he's also at the cutting edge so their agency adapts fast and can be seen as at the cutting edge.

Other people have built and sold businesses, and share their blueprints and so on... that is monetisable

2nd is strategic arbitrage. For example:

My friend talked about ChatGPT update and went viral so this means sharing recent updates in the industry and adapting them. So these have to be current event dependent.

My other friend saw that remote work was on trend, so every hook had remote work or based around that.

I personally use stories too, I'll attach a trending topic like AI or remote work even or Gen-z and then tailor a personal story to match this narrative

So include that in your answer.
```
